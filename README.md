This project is just gathering information about the characters from rick and morty. I gathered the information from an api. I used javascript and jquery to get the information to appear on my browser. This is just a fun/silly app youre able to see what episodes your favorite characters are in, and there status and what demensions they are from. 



I struggled alot in css i wanted to add alot more and be able to make my images pixel when they appear on the page.  I defianlty wanted to get  more information from my api, like there catch phrases and a funny gif or video from a episode. If i had more time i defiantly would of made the page more user friendly, so they can enjoy using the app. The app seems plain.
