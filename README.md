# Aa-code.github.io
My First project I made. Gathering information about the characters from rick and morty the TV show. I gathered the information from an api. I used javascript and jquery to get the information to appear on my browser. This is a perfect app for rick and morty fans who want to learn more about thier favorite characters. Even be able to see what episodes your favorite characters are in, and there status and what demensions they are from. 
This project was made in 1 week. 


## Challenges
I struggled alot in css I wanted to add alot more and be able to make my images pixel when they appear on the page.  I defianlty wanted to get  more information from my api, like there catch phrases and a funny gif or video from a episode. If i had more time I defiantly would of made the page more user friendly, so they can enjoy using the app. The app seems plain.  

## Outcome

Overall I learned how to play with Api's and work with jquery which was awesome! I really love cartoons and look forward to making more websites around my love for cartoon's.
